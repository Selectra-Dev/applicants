- Clone or fork this repository

- Solve as many levels as you can, and in ascending order

    - [Level 1](/resources/levels/1)

    - [Level 2](/resources/levels/2)

    - [Level 3](/resources/levels/3)

    - [Level 4](/resources/levels/4)

    - [Level 5](/resources/levels/5)

    - [Level 6](/resources/levels/6)

    > Levels become more complex over time, so you will probably have to re-use some code and adapt it to the new requirements.

- Give it a try with bonus, even if you have not fully finished all the levels
