# Description

We're happy to welcome you on the technical challenge.

> This is next, and the last, practical test in our recruitment process. Congratulations!

We appreciate your time and engagement. We liked your assessment's answers and now we would like to see you in action!

As you might already know, we're developing our applications mainly in PHP. If you're not comfortable with it you can anything else.

> But remember, if this is your case, using PHP will be a *huge* plus!

Please update this file with installation and test instructions.

We will value yours architecture commentary as we like to see how candidates "talk" technically.

> Please keep the [INSTRUCTIONS.md](/INSTRUCTIONS.md) and resources folder.

# Requirements

We would like your solution to:

- Be host it [GitHub](https://github.com/), or any other **popular** platform
    > We would like to see the commits history and how you handled the repository in general. The importance of it is supported by intense teamwork we conduct in Selectra.

- Be documented
    > Not generic commentary or redundant interface doc-blocks. Document your solution. Can you do UMLs, C4 diagrams? Good!

- Be tested
    > Unit tests will be enough.

Desired traits:

- Flexibility
    > Expect unexpected. Use design patterns.

- Provide self-contained solution
    > We use Docker (and docker-compose).

After all, please don't over-engineer and show-off. We're also programmers - we prefer to receive solid foundation than fully working code.

# Instructions

This task is divided into six parts and a bonus. The complete instructions are available [here](/INSTRUCTIONS.md).

# Summary

Spend as much time as you want. You're not limited to any technology, although don't go crazy with it :).

Good luck and happy coding!
